# Course_OpenCV_for_Beginners
This code was built through the OpenCV Beginners Course, by Satya Mallick, available through the link "https://courses.learnopencv.com/p/opencv-for-beginners". Some changes were made according to my own needs. All the study carried out here, had for objective only didactic purposes, of introduction to the OpenCV library using python3.
